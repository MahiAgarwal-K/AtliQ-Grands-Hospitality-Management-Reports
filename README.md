# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Management-Reports
Business Intelligence project for AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain. Includes metric definitions, Power BI dashboard aligned with stakeholder mock-up, and additional insights on revenue, occupancy, and channel/segment mix to support data-driven decisions and market share growth.

**Problem Statement**
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

**Task**
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

1) Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2) Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3) Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

**Key Insights & Recommendations**
➡️ City Wise Revenue Performance:
Delhi where it’s Occupancy% is high among all four cities but revenue is low. ‘Atliq Grands’ in Delhi has good ratings & Occupancy%, but need pricing strategies as per demand and supply.
➡️ City Wise Occupancy Performance:
Occupancy wise Bangalore is performing low & has a low customer rating along with high cancellations. The ‘AtliQ Grands’ in Bangalore has average rating of 2.7, so the company need to work on the customer service, improve online rating & stay updated in social platforms.
➡️ City Wise RevPar Performance:
Hyderabad has the lowest RevPar, where the occupancy is around 58% but ADR & RevPar is low. The ‘AtliQ Exotica’ has low rating & ADR.

**Business Terms Learnt**
➡️ Average Daily Rate (ADR)
➡️ Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)
➡️ Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN)
➡️ Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
➡️ Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN)
➡️ Difference between Total Bookings vs Total Successful Bookings
➡️ Pricing Strategies: Flat, Weekday/Weekend, Dynamic
➡️ Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)
➡️ Rate vs Occupancy (Inverse Relationship)
1) Data shows that as room rates increase, occupancy tends to decline.
2) Understanding this negative relationship helps in balancing pricing strategy vs. demand.
Example: Dynamic pricing can be optimized to fill rooms on low-demand days without hurting revenue on peak days.
➡️ Ratings & Cancellation Behavior
1) Opportunities lie in improving guest ratings since higher ratings correlate with lower cancellation rates.
2) Data indicates that when average ratings drop, cancellation % rises.
3) Action: Invest in service quality and guest experience to boost ratings, which in turn stabilizes bookings.
➡️ Channel Pricing & Promotions
1) Maintaining pricing parity across OTAs and platforms is key to avoid customer distrust.
However, AtliQ can use its own website for targeted promotions (discounts, bundled offers, loyalty points) to attract direct bookings.
This improves margins by reducing dependence on high-commission channels.

**Additional Recommendations**

➡️ Track Rate-Occupancy elasticity by segment (Business vs Leisure) for precise pricing control.
➡️ Introduce review response strategy (quick replies to negative reviews) to lift ratings.
➡️ Use A/B testing on website offers to measure conversion uplift.
